# About me

👋 Hi, I'm @Zaneives.

I'm a human male, aged 37 (at time of writing. Oct 2022).

👀 I'm an avid learner of many things. I love to watch/listen to informative videos/podcasts in order to understand how things work. 
I'm currently very interested in programming, however I have been throughout my life, since I was young.

🌱 I'm currently learning web development. I believe I have HTML, Javascript and CSS down and working on the Angular framework. Then I'll probably head off to backend.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can build my career/portfolio.

📫 How to reach me? I don't use social media. But you can get hold of me by email: [iveszane@gmail.com](mailto:iveszane@gmail.com). You might be able to get hold of me on [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zane-ives-835a55aa/)
